# SCIMKiller

One-click button on menu bar to kill the SCIM / SCIM_Extension process when you see a rainbow spinwheel on macOS.

__> Why is this better than running the command in terminal?__

Your termimal app could be frozen too when the rainbow spinwheel appears, while menubar buttons are __always__ responsive.
